**Background and Context:**

   We are going to do accent recognition using machine learning. We will train a
neural network on a dataset from kaggle which contains a passage read in
English by over 2000 people from around the world. When complete, our software
should be able to analyze recorded speech and guess the accent of the speaker
to some degree of accuracy. It is probable that the algorithm will require the
speaker to read the same passage it was trained on, unless we can find and use
more data. Our MVP will be a program that records you reading this passage and
guesses your accent, presented with a GUI.


**Key Questions:**

  - What should we use for a GUI?

  - Should we organically create a neural network from scratch of use a module
  such as SKLearn?

  - Do you think our MVP is well scoped?


**Agenda:**

  - First couple minutes explaining a more detailed background of the main idea
  of the project and providing clarification
  - Explanation of tools being used and how to decide which ones are in the
  right scope for the project
  - Ask main questions that are also provided on the feedback form to generate
  discussion
  - Allow time at the end for expression of comments or concerns - will also be
  available on the feedback form if time limit proves to be constricting
